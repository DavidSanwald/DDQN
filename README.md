Watch it in action at the [Gym](https://gym.openai.com/evaluations/eval_GFtDBmuyRjCzcAkBibwYWQ#reproducibility).
The algorithm is based on the great research of such great minds like David Silver, Hado van Hasselt, Vlad Minh and many more in particular (bust not exclusively) on [Double DQN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461).

I also wrote about the algorithm on my blog, if you want to know more:
