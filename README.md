Watch it in action at the Gym here:

The algorithm is based on the great research of such great minds like David Silver, Hado van Hasselt, Vlad Minh and many more in particular (bust not exclusively) on [Double DQN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461).

I also wrote about the algorithm on my blog, if you want to know more:

If you want to reproduce the exact results from the Gym please use the one file [Gist][1], sometimes I feel like doing stupid things with every master branch I  can get my hands on (;
